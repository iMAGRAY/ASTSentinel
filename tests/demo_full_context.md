# Full Context Diff Formatting Demo

## What Changed

The posttooluse hook now provides **FULL FILE CONTEXT** with changes marked, instead of just fragments. This gives AI validators complete visibility into:

1. The entire file structure
2. Where exactly changes are made
3. How changes affect surrounding code
4. Full context for better analysis

## Example Output

### For Edit Operations:
```
=== Full file with Edit changes: test.js ===
   1   function hello() {
   2 -     console.log("Hello");
   2 +     console.log("Hello, World!");
   3       return true;
   4   }
=== End of test.js ===
```

### For Write Operations (comparing old vs new):
```
=== Full file: test.js ===
   1   line 1
   2 - line 2
   2 + line 2 modified
   3   line 3
   4 + line 4
=== End of test.js ===
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Context**: AI sees the entire file, not just snippets
2. **Clear Change Markers**: Lines marked with `-` (removed) and `+` (added)
3. **Line Numbers**: Every line numbered for precise reference
4. **Better Analysis**: AI can understand impact of changes on entire codebase

## Implementation Details

- New functions in `diff_formatter.rs`:
  - `format_full_file_with_changes()` - Shows full file comparison
  - `format_edit_full_context()` - Shows full file with Edit changes applied
  
- Updated `posttooluse.rs`:
  - Now uses full context functions
  - Provides complete file visibility to AI validators
  
- Maintains backward compatibility while enhancing context
