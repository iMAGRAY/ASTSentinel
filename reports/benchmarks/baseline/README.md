Baseline layout for Criterion benchmarks

Why many estimates.json
- Criterion stores statistics per-benchmark in a fixed file name (estimates.json) under deep, unique paths.
- We keep the directory structure as-is to allow stable path matching against current results (scripts/perf_gate.py).

Quick view (aggregated)
- Run: `python3 scripts/perf_baseline_summary.py --baseline reports/benchmarks/baseline > reports/benchmarks/baseline_summary.json`
- Open `reports/benchmarks/baseline_summary.json` for a compact map: relative_path -> mean.

Do not edit baseline files manually
- They are generated by `scripts/perf_gate_save.py` and read by `scripts/perf_gate.py`.
- If you need to refresh, run benches and then: `python3 scripts/perf_gate_save.py`.
