MANDATORY LANGUAGE MATCHING:
You MUST analyze the conversation context and respond in the EXACT SAME LANGUAGE as the user.

AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE DETECTION FROM CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
1. Scan ALL user messages in the conversation context
2. Identify the primary language used by the user:
   - Russian: Contains Cyrillic characters (а, б, в, г, и, etc.)
   - English: Contains only Latin characters
   - Other: Detect accordingly
3. MATCH the user's language in your response

EXAMPLES:
- If you see "[user]: создай файл" → RESPOND IN RUSSIAN
- If you see "[user]: create a file" → respond in English
- If you see mixed languages, use the MOST FREQUENT language

CRITICAL: Language mismatch indicates you're not properly processing the conversation context.
This is a validation failure that must be avoided.
