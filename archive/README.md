# Archived Test Files

This directory contains test files that were moved from the root directory during the codebase cleanup.

These files are kept for historical reference but are not part of the main project structure.

## Contents:
- Various test input files (JSON, JS, Rust)
- Demo and formatting test files
- Debug and parameter test files

For active tests, see the `/tests` and `/test_data` directories in the main project.
