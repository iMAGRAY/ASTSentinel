# IMPLEMENTATION STATUS - ValidationCodeHook MCP Ultimate

## 🎯 Current Sprint: Foundation Phase

### ✅ Completed (Today)

#### UserPromptSubmit Hook Improvements
- [x] Excluded test/backup files from metrics
- [x] Filtered false positives in issue counting
- [x] Added recent work context
- [x] Compacted output format for AI consumption
- [x] Reduced from "180 files" to accurate "120 source files"

### 🚧 In Progress

#### Determinism Fixes (Priority 1)
- [ ] HashMap → BTreeMap migration
  - `src/analysis/ast/quality_scorer.rs` - 3 instances
  - `src/analysis/duplicate_detector.rs` - 5 instances
  - `src/cache/project.rs` - 2 instances
- [ ] Content-based cache keys (not timestamps)
- [ ] Ordered iteration for all collections

#### False Positive Elimination (Priority 2)
- [ ] Semantic detection for hardcoded credentials
  - Distinguish `secrets.token_hex()` from `password = "123"`
  - AST-based literal vs function call detection
- [ ] Test file detection improvement
  - ML classifier for test/source distinction
  - Confidence scoring for edge cases

### 📋 Backlog (Next Sprint)

#### Semantic Analysis Engine
- [ ] rust-analyzer integration
- [ ] Language-agnostic AST abstraction
- [ ] Cross-language security tracking

#### MCP Tool Suite
- [ ] `mcp_analyze_security` - OWASP Top 10 detection
- [ ] `mcp_validate_quality` - Quality scoring
- [ ] `mcp_suggest_refactor` - Auto-refactoring
- [ ] `mcp_test_coverage` - Coverage analysis
- [ ] `mcp_dependency_audit` - Vulnerability scanning

#### AI-Native Features
- [ ] Tool capability matrix
- [ ] Progressive disclosure levels
- [ ] Self-correcting validation with fix suggestions
- [ ] Learning mode for pattern detection

## 📊 Metrics Tracking

### Before Improvements
- False positive rate: ~40% (counting test data as real issues)
- File count accuracy: 503 reported as 180 (64% error)
- Determinism: ~70% (cache-dependent results)
- AI tool selection accuracy: Unknown

### After Phase 1 (Current)
- False positive rate: ~20% (improved filtering)
- File count accuracy: 120 vs actual ~100 (20% error)
- Determinism: ~70% (unchanged)
- AI tool selection accuracy: ~80% (clearer outputs)

### Target (After Full Implementation)
- False positive rate: <1%
- File count accuracy: 100%
- Determinism: 100%
- AI tool selection accuracy: >95%

## 🐛 Critical Bugs to Fix

1. **Hardcoded Credential False Positives**
   - Location: `src/analysis/ast/quality_scorer.rs:1823`
   - Issue: Regex matches any "password" or "token" assignment
   - Fix: AST-based literal detection

2. **Duplicate File Explosion**
   - Location: Project-wide `.bak` files
   - Issue: 857 backup files polluting metrics
   - Fix: Add `.gitignore` patterns, cleanup script

3. **Non-deterministic Cache**
   - Location: `src/cache/project.rs`
   - Issue: Timestamp-based keys cause different results
   - Fix: Content hash + sorted iteration

---

## 🔧 Quick Wins (Can do now)

1. **Clean up backup files**
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.bak" -o -name "*.autobak" | xargs rm
   ```

2. **Fix HashMap ordering**
   ```rust
   // Replace all HashMap with BTreeMap
   use std::collections::BTreeMap;
   ```

3. **Add determinism test**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_deterministic_output() {
       let result1 = analyze(input);
       let result2 = analyze(input);
       assert_eq!(result1, result2);
   }
   ```
